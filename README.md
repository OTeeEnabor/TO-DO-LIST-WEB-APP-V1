## About Nuxeo

Nuxeo Content Platform is an open source Enterprise Content Management platform, written in Java. Data can be stored in both SQL & NoSQL databases.

The development of the Nuxeo Content Platform is mostly done by Nuxeo employees with an open development model.

The source code, documentation, roadmap, issue tracker, testing, benchmarks are all public.

Typically, Nuxeo users build different types of information management solutions for [document management](https://www.nuxeo.com/products/document-management/), [case management](https://www.nuxeo.com/products/case-management/), and [digital asset management](https://www.nuxeo.com/products/digital-asset-management/), use cases. It uses schema-flexible metadata & content models that allows content to be repurposed to fulfill future use cases.
